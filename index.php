                    Why did we create this page? As we didn¥t find an interesting website about our 
                    city, we decided to create one ourselves. We wanted people from the whole world 
                    to be acquainted with Koöice. We want to inform people, who don¥t know where to 
                    go through the Holidays, to consider visiting our city. We also a provide a playful 
                    quiz game about the history and points of interests of the city. Besides that we 
                    handpicked the pictures that give you an insight to the city¥s life and style. 
                    We hope you¥ll like our take on Koöice and you will visit it in the future.
