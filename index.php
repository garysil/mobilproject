		Why did we create this page? As we didn´t find an interesting website about our 
		city, we decided to create one ourselves. We wanted people from the whole world 
		to be acquainted with Kosice. We want to inform people, who don´t know where to 
		go through the Holidays, to consider visiting our city. We also a provide a playful 
		quiz game about the history and points of interests of the city. Besides that we 
		handpicked the pictures that give you an insight to the city´s life and style. 
		We hope you´ll like our take on Kosice and you will visit it in the future.
